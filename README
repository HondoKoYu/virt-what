This is a collection of scripts which you can use to work out what
sort of virtualization you are running inside.

Build:

  ./configure
  make

If you want to run the automated tests:

  make check

If you want to run it from the local directory, then you have to set
the PATH:

  PATH=.:$PATH virt-what

or since virt-what normally needs to be run as root:

  su -c 'PATH=.:$PATH virt-what'

To install (usually as root):

  make install

also:

  make prefix=/usr install
  make DESTDIR=/tmp/somewhere install
